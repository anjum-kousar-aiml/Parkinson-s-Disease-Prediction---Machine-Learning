# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction---Machine-Learning
This repository contains a Machine Learning project using the Random Forest Classifier works by creating a "forest" of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes or the mean prediction of the individual trees . It's known for its accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality
