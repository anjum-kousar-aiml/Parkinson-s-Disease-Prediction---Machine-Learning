# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction---Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting ** Parkinson's Disease** using biomedical voice measurements, leveraging a **Random Forest Classifier**. THe model is trained on a real-world dataset containing vocal biomarkers from individuals. This work demonstrates how machine learning can play a critical role in early and accurate diagnosis of neurological disorders.
## Dataset Link
You can access the dataset used in this project here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons
## About the Dataset
This dataset consists of a range of voice recordings and features such as:
Jitter, Shimmer< HNR( Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio), Fundamental frequency measures.
These features are highly sensitive to subtle vocal impairments caused by Parkinson's Disease, making then valuable for diagnostic modeling.
## Machine Learning Model
Model: Random Forest Classifier
As it builds multiple decision trees during training and aggregates their outputs. It's accurate - ideal for medical features with complex interactions.
## Project Highlights
Explored feature importance and correlations
Trained and fine-tuned a Random Forest model
Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and, classification report
Visualized feature combinations and model predictions
