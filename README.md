# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction---Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice measurements, leveraging a Random Forest Classifier. THe model is trained on a real-world dataset containing vocal biomarkers from individuals. This work demonstrates how machine learning can play a critical role in early and accurate diagnosis of neurological disorders.
